Meet the granddad of the modern electronic calculator. Called the Magic Brain, it promised special powers of addition, subtraction and multiplication.

Operated with a stylus, you perform calculations by manipulating the numbers - black for addition and red for subtraction. To clear the numbers and start a new calculation, you pull the wire bar at the top and push it down.

Graeme got the calculator pictured in the 1960s. It was a big deal at the time, promising an easy way to solve mathematical problems. Whilst he no longer has the stylus or the original instructions, a little Internet searching turned up the steps for performing a simple addition:

> Put the point of the stylus into the right-hand slot directly opposite the number you wish to add. If the indicated slot is RED ... pull DOWN ... If the slot is WHITE ... push the stylus all the way UP, OVER and DOWN around the curve (unless this operation is performed properly, the figure will not carry over into the second window). Practice this many times with simple figures until you have mastered the technique.

So, all you need is a few weeks and you'll be performing calculations like a charm.

Fast forward a few years to sometime in the 1970s and electronic calculators came on the scene. Graeme recalls being in awe of the technology.

> I was working for the Government at the time, and I remember borrowing an electronic calculator from a dealer for a weekend. At the time it cost something like US$200\. It was a big deal. I recall that the model I borrowed was featured on the cover page of News Week magazine.

Within a few years pocket electronic calculators became accessible to the masses. Advances in technology made what was once a staggering US$200, a more affordable US$20\.

These days, Graeme rarely has the need to perform mathematical calculations. If he does, he tends to use Excel or his solar powered calculator. He's yet to try the calculator app on his cell phone.
